  <p style="text-align: left"> 

<br> <span style="font-weight:bold">


The Numbers  that we add are called Additon.

<br> Here are the examples:

<br>  <br> 

      a)  4+2=6																
<br>

		b)  199+199= 398
<br> 

     <br> There is a  method to do the addtion that is: 
  
 <br>  Example: 900+295= 1,195
	 
	  
	  <br>  <br>
      1st Step	 Write above Thousands Hundreds Tens And <br>
	 Ones and if you have more numbers that can not <br>
	 be plce in the thousand you can write ten thousands
	 also. 
	 </p>
	 <br>
	  <br>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">

	  Here is a chart to remeber Ones Tens and all. <br>

	 
	 <br>O for ones 
	 <br> T for tens 
	 <br> H for hundreds 
	 <br> Th for thousands 
	 <br> Thh for ten thousands 
	 <br> L for lakhs 
	 <br> Tl for Ten Lakhs </p>
	 
	  <br>  <br>
      <p style="text-align: left"> 

	  2nd Step is to write the numbers in correct place.
	  <br>  <br>
       3rd Step is to add the numbers and then get the correct answer.</span>

This is abacus. 



Fisrt Step: We have to write Ones, tens and so on if there are more numbers then there should be more than tens ones rod
<br> We have to make balls called beads. The yellow balss are beads.

<br>

Here is an example.

	<h1 style="color:red;font-size:21px;">Now Let us the understand the Addition In Abacus.</h1> 



The Addition of Abacus is very esay. As before the topic we have learnt 
that how to write 
and know the numbers shown
in the abacus. The Addtion Of Abacus is that we need two 
abacus with the number and the we will write 
the equal to sign 
after that we will write the numbbers with abacus. As shwon below:- 

<br>

Here is an example shown below:-

<br> 
<br>
<br>

So now we have understand how to do addition on abacus. 

<br>

Now let's do one question:

<br>

This will be easy one ok.. 

<br>
<br>

a) 100 + 459 = ??

<br>
<br>

b) 200 + 500 = ?? 
<br>

<br>

In the first one you have to make an abacus and put the first numbers that is 100.
<br> 

And then draw one more same abacus and put the second number that is 459.

<br>

And guess what you have to put lastly one more abacus and add both the numbers using
<br>

abacus and the answer that you will get you have to draw that much balls according to the lines in abacus.
